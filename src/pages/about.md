title: About
---
My last 6 years of professional experience has focused on project management-related roles and responsibilities. My specialty is the ability to bridge the communications gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders. 

<u>A systems thinker</u> - I enjoy gathering requirements and sharing through flows and specifications.

<u>An organizer</u> - I provide structure and balance for teams from business-as-usual through unchartered territories.  

<u>A facilitator</u> - I'm passionate about the art and science of workshop design and providing resources to others.

<u>A storyteller</u> - I capture knowledge and produce data-driven insights through powerful visualizations.
